                <li>We are a North-American server. You must speak and understand English at all times.</li>
                <li>You must have a working microphone with no background noise and crystal clear output. Voice changers are acceptable, but they must be understandable and not overly loud, too quiet, or extremely high or low pitched.</li>
                <li>Players with a VAC ban are prohibited. Unfortunately, we cannot make exceptions as our system will automatically deny all VAC-banned Steam accounts.</li>
                <li>Do not be toxic or breed toxicity of any kind.</li>
                <li>The use of glitches, exploits, or hacks is prohibited. If you find a glitch or exploit, please notify the admin team through a bug report on Discord.</li>
                <li>Abide by the Twitch Terms of Service (ToS), Twitch Community Guidelines, and Discord Terms of Service while in the city and Discord.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>No KOS (kill on sight) unless it is an agreed-upon between gangs in your respected territory (see Gang Guidelines below) or both parties have made a mutual introduction and understand why combat is occurring. Do not RDM (random death match) or VDM (vehicle deathmatch). You must have a logical reason for killing someone.</li>
                <li>You must value your character's life and the lives of other characters at all times. Therefore, your character's personality and mannerisms should portray fear when faced with a life threat. For example, if you have a gun pointed at you, put your hands up.</li>
                <li>Do not harass or disrespect other members or management. Instead, show respect to other players and keep the real-life drama out of roleplay. Do not use derogatory remarks regarding race, national origin, gender, religion, disabilities, or sexual preference. Do not base a character's roleplay around being heavily toxic, aggressive, or discriminatory.</li>
                <li>You have the right to bear arms inside your home, business, or place of employment. Therefore, you may use deadly force inside your home, business, or place of work if your character's life is at risk. Home and business owners may choose to disallow this at their discretion. Police may ignore hostage-takers demands while at any police precinct.</li>
